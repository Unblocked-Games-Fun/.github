### **Unblocked Games: What Are They and Why Are They Popular?**

Unblocked games are online games that can be played on school or office networks where access to certain websites is typically restricted. These games are not blocked by network filters or firewalls, making them accessible to players even in places with strict internet policies. Students and employees often turn to unblocked games to kill time, relax, or have fun during breaks.

The term "unblocked" simply refers to games that bypass network restrictions or firewalls designed to prevent access to entertainment websites. These games can be played directly through a browser without requiring installation or downloading of any software. Many of these games are simple, flash-based, and come with easy-to-understand mechanics, making them perfect for casual gaming during short breaks.
